# caching

set Expires (HTTP/1.0) + Cache-Control (HTTP/1.1);
Cache-Control overrides Expires for HTTP/1.1+

Use "Vary: List-Headers-That-Affect-Cached-Content" if origin server
serves different content depending on supplied headers. Keep in mind
that when using caching CDNs or Proxies that satisfy this setting you
should reduce the number of possible values (normalize) of specified headers,
to match the actual number of different variations generated by the server,
otherwise the caching proxy will keep lots of duplicates and keep hitting
the server for every different header value.
