MQTT requires a broker (mosca, mosquitto, paho, etc) and clients to work.

MQTT.js is a client library that can be used both on Node server and in browser.

Browser-side client requires MQTT to be used over Websockets (connect to ws:// or wss://).
Server-side client can also connect to a Websocket endpoint.

Debugging MQTT messages can be bounced off http://test.mosquitto.org
or ws://test.mosquitto.org:8080/mqtt
