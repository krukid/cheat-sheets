chartist --
  works well with SSR, integratable styles and such, but lacks the ability to
  mix several types of charts and display different scales at the same time

chart.js --
  does not work with SSR out of the box, but can be wrapped in a CSR-only
  component. allows mixing various types of charts, but such advanced use
  causes lots of rendering bugs that can't be worked around

flot --
  doesn't work with SSR, depends on jquery, but can be customized rather well.
  a workaround is to display it in an iframe and package separately from main
  code

google charts --
  ?
