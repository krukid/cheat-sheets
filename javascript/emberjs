### gotchas and workarounds

1. emberjs is heavily opinionated when using ember-data.
   if your api doesn't comply with jsonapi spec, then create your own
   application/model serializers that will munge your payloads to
   resemble a jsonapi document/fragment (meta, relationships, attributes, ...)

2. emberjs tries to optimize different aspects of the app based on
   assumptions and conventions, one of them being NOT reloading your model
   if you're using dynamic segments in your route and navigating to that route
   via link-to or transitionToRoute methods.

   to work around this, we use before/after model hooks on your route handler
   (that are called ALWAYS) and reload the model manually:
