# linux partition suddenly deleted and grub can't find config file

grub boots into a terminal prompt "grub>" and linux /boot/vmlinuz root=...
has no effect.

create a grub rescue disk (usb) and boot from it. open terminal and run
`parted /dev/sda` or `./testdisk_static` (dl from inet) and figure out
which partition used to be your boot partition
(ubuntu uses ext4, one of these tools prints out such info when highlighting
partitions, typically swap partition comes after boot partition,
so that's another hint) => /dev/sdaX

run `fsck /dev/sdaX` and agree to all fix prompts; reboot.

grub should boot into normal menu mode and you can boot into linux again.
